# odin-recipes
This is my first project from the Odin Project

Building a recipe page helped me instill the basic of html boilerplate, lists, headings, paragraphs, alternative texts, links, and images. I've learn to do commits often and to write good comments on them. I still need to improve on that. Overall this first project has given me some confidence to move foward in my web development journy.
